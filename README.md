# A Machine Learning Approach for Analyzing Energy Market Dynamics

This repository contains the code, analysis, and documentation from my project **‚ÄúA Machine Learning Approach for Analyzing Energy Market Dynamics‚Äù**. The project forecasts **diesel, E5, and E10 prices** in Germany using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods.  

---

## üìå Project Description  

Fuel price volatility in Germany, particularly for **diesel, E5, and E10 gasoline**, has become a critical issue due to its impact on consumers, businesses, and national policy. Sudden changes in international oil markets, exchange rates, and electricity prices create uncertainty that affects transportation costs, supply chains, and energy transition strategies.  

This project addresses these challenges by:  
- Building a **data pipeline** to collect, clean, and process information from multiple sources (Tankerk√∂nig API, EIA, Bundesnetzagentur, ECB).  
- Performing **exploratory statistical analysis** to understand fuel price behavior across German states and in response to international drivers.  
- Developing and comparing **forecasting models**:  
  - **Statistical models** ‚Üí ARIMA, VAR  
  - **Machine Learning models** ‚Üí Random Forest, XGBoost  
  - **Deep Learning models** ‚Üí LSTM, GRU  
- Evaluating models with metrics such as **MSE, RMSE, MAE, and Accuracy**.  
- Identifying the most relevant factors influencing fuel prices, including international crude oil benchmarks (WTI, Brent), exchange rates (EUR/USD), electricity generation, and financial indices (DAX40, S&P500).  

The project is divided into two complementary components:  
- **Data_Analysis.ipynb** ‚Üí the **pipeline and statistical foundation**, responsible for data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.  
- **Model Analysis.ipynb** ‚Üí the **forecasting and evaluation framework**, where multiple models are implemented and compared.  

This repository serves as both an **academic contribution** and a **practical toolkit**:  
- For researchers ‚Üí providing a comparative study of classical and modern forecasting methods.  
- For policymakers and businesses ‚Üí offering insights to improve risk management and strategic planning in volatile fuel markets.  
- For data scientists ‚Üí showcasing an end-to-end workflow, from raw data extraction to advanced model evaluation.

## üéØ Problem & Context  

Fuel prices in Germany are highly volatile, influenced by international crude oil markets, exchange rates, electricity prices, and geopolitical shocks.  
This volatility directly affects **consumers** (household costs), **businesses** (transportation and supply chains), and **policymakers** (energy security, inflation control, and transition strategies).  

### Challenges Addressed:
- Daily fluctuations in **diesel, E5, and E10 gasoline** prices with no clear patterns.  
- Limited predictive capacity of traditional econometric models in capturing sudden shocks.  
- Need for more **transparent and accurate forecasting tools** to support decision-making in the German energy market.

## üéØ Objectives & Research Questions  

**Main Goal:**  
To develop and evaluate predictive models for short-term fuel prices in Germany, using both domestic and international market indicators.  

**Specific Objectives:**  
1. Create a **data pipeline** to gather and preprocess fuel and energy data from diverse sources.  
2. Apply **statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models** to forecast daily fuel prices.  
3. Compare model performance across accuracy metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, Accuracy).  
4. Identify the **key drivers** of fuel price fluctuations in Germany.  
5. Provide insights for **strategic planning and risk management** in volatile fuel markets.  

**Research Question:**  
*Which supervised learning models are most suitable for predicting daily changes in German fuel prices (diesel, E5, E10), and how does their performance differ when incorporating additional variables such as international oil prices, exchange rates, and electricity generation?*

## üîÑ Data Pipeline & Model Analysis  

This project is structured into two complementary parts, following the methodology described in the thesis:

1. **Data Analysis & Pipeline (üìì `Data_Analysis.ipynb`)**  
2. **Modeling & Evaluation (üìì `Model Analysis.ipynb`)**

Together, these components form an end-to-end framework for forecasting German fuel prices.

### üîë Integrated Findings

- International oil prices (**WTI & Brent**) and exchange rates (**EUR/USD**) are the **strongest predictors** of German fuel prices.  
- **Electricity prices** show moderate correlation, indicating substitution effects with electromobility.  
- **VAR** and **GRU** achieved the best results overall, with GRU excelling in capturing non-linear dependencies.  
- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** are strong alternatives for interpretable, reliable forecasts.  
- **LSTM** was less effective in this dataset, confirming the importance of choosing architectures carefully.

## üìä Results & Discussion  

The comparative evaluation shows that no single model dominates in all scenarios. Instead, performance depends on the forecasting horizon and the inclusion of external variables.  

- **ARIMA**: Delivered accurate short-term forecasts but struggled with structural shocks and volatility.  
- **VAR**: Outperformed other models in capturing multivariate dependencies between fuel types, oil prices, and exchange rates.  
- **Random Forest & XGBoost**: Achieved strong predictive accuracy with interpretable results, making them practical for real-world applications.  
- **LSTM**: Overfitted the data, resulting in lower accuracy compared to other approaches.  
- **GRU**: The best-performing deep learning model, with robust results, faster training, and superior generalization compared to LSTM.  

All results, including comparative tables, error metrics, and plots of forecasts vs. actual prices, are available in the notebooks.  
üìå The **data pipeline and preprocessing code** is included in this repository (`Prices_code_v1.ipynb`).

## üîë Key Insights  

- **Global oil benchmarks (WTI, Brent)** and the **EUR/USD exchange rate** are the strongest predictors of German fuel prices.  
- **Electricity prices** show moderate correlation, suggesting substitution effects from electromobility.  
- Forecasting methods must balance **interpretability (Random Forest, XGBoost)** with **accuracy (VAR, GRU)** depending on the use case.  
- Policymakers, businesses, and consumers can benefit from improved forecasting to **manage risk, optimize supply chains, and increase transparency**.

## üîÆ Future Work  

This project provides a solid foundation, but several extensions are possible:  

- Incorporating **taxation policies** and **regional transport costs** into the models.  
- Expanding analysis to other **energy commodities** (coal, natural gas, renewables).  
- Applying **Explainable AI methods (e.g., SHAP values)** to better interpret model decisions.  
- Building a **real-time dashboard** to provide alerts and forecasts for stakeholders.  
- Extending the scope from Berlin/state-level data to **national and EU-level comparisons**.  

The pipeline and model code in this repository can be adapted for these future directions.
